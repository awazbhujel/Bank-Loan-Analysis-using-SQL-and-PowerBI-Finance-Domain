## Overview

This project focuses on analyzing bank loan data to derive insights into loan portfolio performance, customer behavior, and risk assessment. Leveraging SQL for data processing and Power BI for visualization, the analysis aims to deliver actionable insights into loan repayment trends, default probabilities, and customer segmentation. By integrating data-driven decision-making into operational strategies, the bank can optimize lending practices, mitigate risks, and enhance overall financial performance.

## Bank Loan Domain Knowledge

### How Banks Collect Loan Data?

Banks collect loan data through various channels, including loan applications, credit reports, income verification, collateral evaluation, and online platforms.

## Process of Granting a Loan

The process of granting a loan typically involves application, documentation, credit assessment, underwriting, approval, loan agreement, funding, loan servicing, risk management, and closure.

## Reasons for Analyzing Bank Loan Data

Analyzing loan data helps banks in risk management, decision-making, performance monitoring, fraud detection, and gaining customer insights.

## About Dataset
The dataset used in this analysis contains information about loan applicants, including attributes such as credit score, income, employment length, loan amount, and loan status.

data set descriptions:

id: This column likely represents a unique identifier for each loan application or borrower in the dataset.

address_state: This column contains the state where the borrower resides or where the loan was originated.

application_type: This column indicates the type of loan application, which could be individual or joint (if multiple applicants are involved).

emp_length: This column represents the length of employment for the borrower, typically measured in years.

emp_title: This column contains the job title or occupation of the borrower.

grade: This column represents the risk grade assigned to the loan by the lending institution, usually based on the borrower's creditworthiness.

home_ownership: This column indicates the type of home ownership status of the borrower, such as own, mortgage, rent, etc.

issue_date: This column denotes the date when the loan was issued or originated.

last_credit_pull_date: This column indicates the date when the lender last pulled the borrower's credit report.

last_payment_date: This column represents the date of the last payment made by the borrower.

loan_status: This column indicates the current status of the loan, such as fully paid, charged off, in default, etc.

next_payment_date: This column might denote the date of the next scheduled payment on the loan.

member_id: This column likely represents a unique identifier for each member or borrower in the dataset.

purpose: This column specifies the purpose of the loan, such as debt consolidation, home improvement, medical expenses, etc.

sub_grade: This column provides a more granular classification of the loan grade, typically used in credit scoring systems.

term: This column indicates the duration of the loan, usually measured in months (e.g., 36 months, 60 months).

verification_status: This column denotes whether the borrower's income and other information have been verified by the lender.

annual_income: This column represents the annual income of the borrower.

dti: This column stands for debt-to-income ratio, which measures the borrower's total monthly debt payments relative to their gross monthly income.

installment: This column denotes the monthly payment amount due on the loan.

int_rate: This column represents the interest rate charged on the loan.

loan_amount: This column indicates the total amount of the loan that was disbursed to the borrower.

total_acc: This column represents the total number of credit accounts the borrower has.

total_payment: This column might indicate the total amount paid by the borrower over the life of the loan.

## Problem Statement

The objective of this project is to perform comprehensive analysis of bank loan data using SQL and to create key performance indicator (KPI) metrics to assess loan portfolio performance.
